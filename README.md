# terra_transcender

**Description**: This project was created as a part of Nasa Space Apps Challenge Hackathon.

### Aim:

Our aim is to build an app that will help close the gap among people of Earth caused due to inequalities such as racism, gender bias, caste discrimination etc. 
The app is called 'Terra Transcender' meaning 'to transcend all divides and limitations that humanity has set for itself'. 
We wish to create a sense of togetherness by showing the users that our Earth is all we have, so we must protect it with unity.

### Screens:

The app has four major Screens :

1. **Sapiens in Space** : To show people how diverse astronauts are and inspire them to be a part of space science irrespective of their limitations/backgrounds(inequalities, bias etc.).

2. **Earth from Space** : Give an experience of Overview Effect - visualizing earth from space so that they can realize that the Earth is all we have, so the differences doesn't matter. We are one human race.

3. **Mission Integrity** : Give an insight about how space missions work - involving all crew members and striving towards one goal - Everybody needs to be alive. Applying the essence of space missions in everyday life to tackle inequalities.

4. **Space near me** : Inform and educate about the local space collaborations with NASA (ISRO-NASA).
